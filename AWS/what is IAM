how to restrict access to one S3 bucket to user :
 resource base policy: create a resource base policy then attach to that bucket:go to amazon s3 ->  buckets -> choose bucket -> click on permissions -> edit -> then paste this policy

            "Action": "s3:*",                        #"Action": "s3:GetObject",
