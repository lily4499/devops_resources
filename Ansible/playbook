Here are multiple examples of Ansible playbooks with explanations of each module and task:

Example 1: Install and start Apache service

```
- name: Install and start Apache service
  hosts: all
  become: true
  
  tasks:
  - name: Install Apache
    yum:
      name: httpd
      state: present
    notify: 
      - Start Apache
  
  - name: Start Apache
    service: 
      name: httpd
      state: started
```

Explanation: This playbook hosts all servers and installs Apache on all of them through the `yum` module. Then the `service` module is used to start the Apache service.

Example 2: Copy file to remote server

```
- name: Copy nginx config file to remote server
  hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    nginx_config_file: "/path/to/nginx.conf"

  tasks:
  - name: Copy nginx config file to remote server
    copy:
      src: "{{ nginx_config_file }}"
      dest: "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf"
```

Explanation: This playbook defines the file path to the Nginx configuration file `nginx_config_file` and then copies that file to the remote server's `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` using the `copy` module.

Example 3: Install and start MariaDB

```
- name: Install and start MariaDB
  hosts: all
  become: true

  tasks:
  - name: Install MariaDB
    yum: 
      name: mariadb-server
      state: present
    notify:
      - Start MariaDB

  - name: Start MariaDB
    service: 
      name: mariadb
      state: started
```

Explanation: This playbook installs MariaDB using the `yum` module and then starts it using the `service` module.

Example 4: Restart HTTPD service if configuration files are changed

```
- name: Restart HTTPD service if configuration files are changed
  hosts: all
  become: true

  tasks:
  - name: Copy httpd config file to remote server
    copy:
      src: "/path/to/httpd.conf"
      dest: "/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf"
      owner: root
      group: root
      mode: "0644"
    notify:
      - Restart HTTPD

  - name: Restart HTTPD
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: restarted
```

Explanation: This playbook copies the `httpd.conf` file to the remote server's `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` directory using the `copy` module. The `notify` directive specifies that the `Restart HTTPD` task should be triggered. When the configuration file is changed, the `service` module restarts the HTTPD service.

Example 5: Add a user with sudo access

```
- name: Add user with sudo access
  hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    username: "username"
    password: "password"

  tasks:
  - name: Add user
    user:
      name: "{{ username }}"
      password: "{{ password | password_hash('sha512') }}"
      shell: /bin/bash
      createhome: yes
      update_password: on_create
  
  - name: Add user to sudoers
    copy:
      content: "{{ username }} ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL"
      dest: "/etc/sudoers.d/{{ username }}"
      owner: root
      group: root
      mode: "0440"
```

Explanation: This playbook adds a new user to the system with the given username and password. The `user` module creates the new user and sets their password using the `password_hash` filter. It then adds the new user to the `wheel` group so that they have sudo access. The `copy` module adds the new user to the `sudoers` file so they can run sudo commands without a password.

Here are a few complex examples of Ansible playbooks with explanations of each module and task:

Example 1: Provision an entire environment with multiple roles

```
- name: Provision an entire environment with multiple roles
  hosts: all
  become: true
  
  roles:
    - webserver
    - database
    - memcached
    - loadbalancer
```

Explanation: This playbook provisions an entire environment with multiple roles. It uses the `roles` directive to include separate roles for web server, database, memcached, and load balancer. Each role contains its own playbook.

Example 2: Deploy a Python Flask application with Nginx as reverse proxy

```
- name: Deploy a Python Flask application with Nginx as reverse proxy
  hosts: webserver
  become: true
  vars:
    application_name: "MyFlaskApp"
    app_directory: "/var/www/{{ application_name }}"
  
  tasks:
  - name: Install Python packages
    pip:
      name:
        - Flask
        - gunicorn
      state: present

  - name: Copy application code to remote server
    copy:
      src: "/path/to/application"
      dest: "{{ app_directory }}"
  
  - name: Start Gunicorn
    command: "gunicorn --bind 127.0.0.1:5000 app:app"
    args:
      chdir: "{{ app_directory }}"
    async: 10
    poll: 0
    become: true
    register: gunicorn_process

  - name: Configure Nginx as reverse proxy
    copy:
      src: "/path/to/nginx.conf"
      dest: "/etc/nginx/sites-available/{{ application_name }}"
      owner: root
      group: root
      mode: "0644"
    notify:
      - Enable site

  - name: Enable site
    command: "ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/{{ application_name }} /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/"
    become: true
    notify:
      - Reload Nginx

  - name: Reload Nginx
    service:
      name: nginx
      state: reloaded
```

Explanation: This playbook deploys a Python Flask application with Nginx as a reverse proxy. The `pip` module installs Flask and Gunicorn. It then copies the application code to the remote server's `app_directory`. The `command` module starts Gunicorn on port 5000 and registers it to a variable for monitoring. The `copy` module copies the Nginx configuration file to `/etc/nginx/sites-available/{{ application_name }}`. Then the `command` module creates a symbolic link for the enabled site and restarts Nginx.

Example 3: Deploy and configure Elasticsearch cluster with Kibana web interface

```
- name: Deploy and configure Elasticsearch cluster with Kibana web interface
  hosts: elasticsearch
  become: true

  pre_tasks:
  - name: Disable swap
    command: "swapoff -a"
    become: true
    ignore_errors: true
  
  tasks:
  - name: Add Elasticsearch repository
    apt_repository:
      repo: "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/apt stable main"
      state: present
      filename: elasticsearch
      keyserver: hkp://pgp.mit.edu
      key_id: "D27D666CD88E42B4"

  - name: Install Elasticsearch
    apt:
      name: elasticsearch
      state: present

  - name: Configure Elasticsearch cluster
    copy:
      src: "/path/to/elasticsearch.yml"
      dest: "/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml"
      owner: elasticsearch
      group: elasticsearch
      mode: "0644"
    notify:
      - Restart Elasticsearch

  - name: Install Kibana
    apt:
      name: kibana
      state: present

  - name: Configure Kibana
    copy:
      src: "/path/to/kibana.yml"
      dest: "/etc/kibana/kibana.yml"
      owner: kibana
      group: kibana
      mode: "0644"
    notify:
      - Restart Kibana
  
  handlers:
  - name: Restart Elasticsearch
    service:
      name: elasticsearch
      state: restarted
  
  - name: Restart Kibana
    service:
      name: kibana
      state: restarted
```

Explanation: This playbook installs Elasticsearch and Kibana on the specified host(s). The `apt_repository` module adds the Elasticsearch repository to the server. It then uses the `apt` module to install Elasticsearch and Kibana. The `copy` module copies the Elasticsearch and Kibana configuration files to their respective directories. The `handlers` section restarts Elasticsearch and Kibana after changes are made to their configuration files.

Certainly! Here are multiple examples of Ansible playbooks, along with explanations of the modules and tasks used in each playbook:

Example 1: Installing Packages

yaml
Copy code
---
- name: Install Packages
  hosts: web_servers
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt cache
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
      become: yes
      
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      become: yes
Explanation:

This playbook aims to install Nginx on a group of web servers (web_servers).
The apt module updates the APT package cache and installs Nginx.
The become keyword allows tasks to be executed with elevated privileges (similar to sudo).
Example 2: Managing Files

yaml
Copy code
---
- name: Copy Configuration File
  hosts: app_servers
  tasks:
    - name: Copy nginx.conf
      copy:
        src: /path/to/local/nginx.conf
        dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      become: yes
      notify:
        - Restart Nginx
  handlers:
    - name: Restart Nginx
      systemd:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted
Explanation:

This playbook copies an nginx.conf file from the local machine to /etc/nginx/ on app servers.
The copy module performs the file copy operation.
The handlers section defines tasks that are triggered when notified by other tasks. In this case, when the configuration file is copied, it triggers the Restart Nginx handler.
The systemd module is used in the handler to restart the Nginx service.
Example 3: User Management

yaml
Copy code
---
- name: Create Users
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Create user
      user:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop:
        - user1
        - user2
      become: yes
Explanation:

This playbook creates user accounts on all hosts.
The user module is used to manage user accounts. In this case, it creates users user1 and user2.
The loop directive allows the same task to be executed for each item in the list.
Example 4: Conditional Tasks

yaml
Copy code
---
- name: Install Package Based on OS
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install package
      package:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop:
        - nginx
        - apache2
      when: 
        - ansible_distribution == 'Ubuntu'
Explanation:

This playbook installs different packages (nginx or apache2) based on the operating system.
The package module is used to manage packages.
The when keyword allows tasks to be executed conditionally. In this case, the task is only executed on Ubuntu systems.
Example 5: Using Roles

yaml
Copy code
---
- name: Deploy Web Application
  hosts: app_servers
  roles:
    - webapp
Explanation:

This playbook deploys a web application on app servers using a role named webapp.
Roles allow you to encapsulate tasks, variables, and files into reusable components.
The webapp role would have its own directory structure containing tasks, variables, templates, and other necessary files.
These examples cover various scenarios using Ansible playbooks. The modules used (e.g., apt, copy, user, package, systemd, etc.) represent a subset of Ansible's extensive module library. The playbooks demonstrate how Ansible can automate tasks related to package management, file management, user management, conditional execution, and even the usage of roles for more organized configuration management.

        image: ami-12345678
        wait: yes
        count: 1
      register: ec2_instance_info

    - name: Add New Instance to Inventory
      add_host:
        name: "{{ item.private_ip }}"
        groups: new_instances
      loop: "{{ ec2_instance_info.instances }}"
Explanation:

This playbook provisions and configures AWS EC2 instances.
Creates an EC2 instance using the ec2_instance module and registers information in the ec2_instance_info variable.
Adds the newly created instances to the inventory using the add_host module and assigns them to the new_instances group.
These examples demonstrate more complex use cases of Ansible, such as deploying multi-tier applications, enabling continuous deployment workflows, and provisioning AWS resources. The tasks leverage various Ansible modules, including apt, copy, template, service, git, and ec2_instance, to achieve the desired automation outcomes. Keep in mind that these examples are meant to illustrate complex scenarios, and you may need to adapt them to your specific environment and requirements.
