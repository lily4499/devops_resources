The error message suggests that there are some unmet dependencies that prevent the installation of the `docker.io` and `firewalld` packages. Specifically, it seems that the `containerd.io` package is in conflict with the `containerd` package.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Update the package lists:

   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. Install the dependencies manually:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install -y containerd.io
   ```

3. Remove any conflicting packages (if present):

   ```
   sudo apt-get remove -y containerd
   ```

4. Install `docker.io` and `firewalld`:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install -y docker.io firewalld
   ```

If the above steps don't work, it's possible that there are some other conflicting packages that need to be removed or updated first. You can use the `aptitude` command to resolve complex dependency issues:

```
sudo apt-get install -y aptitude
sudo aptitude install -y docker.io firewalld
```

`aptitude` will try to resolve the dependency issues and suggest a solution that you can review and accept or reject. You can also use the `-f` option to force the installation of packages and resolve any conflicts automatically:

```
sudo apt-get install -f
```

After resolving the dependency issues, you should be able to install `docker.io` and `firewalld` without any problems.
