 Python Script to check if the file or directory exists
Checking If the file exists or not is very important, as you want to make sure that file exists before you open it or before you are writing to that file, or before you overwrite that file.

In Python, there are different ways to check whether the file exists:
1.open()
2.os.path()
3.Pathlib

Approach 1:
Let start with open()
In your python console, try to open a non-existing file using open(). You will get a FileNotFoundError.
>>> open("abc.txt")
Try to open a file to which you don’t have permission. You can create a file and then change the permission via chmod.
touch filetest
chmod 100 filetest
Now in your Python console, try to open that file.
>>> open("filetest")
This time you got a different error PermissionError.

Let’s explore one more use case in which you try to open a directory. This time you got IsADirectoryError.
>>> open("/etc")
We need to write our script in such a manner to handle these exceptions gracefully. To do this, we can use try/except block.
try:  
	with open("abc.txt") as f:    
		print(f.read())
except Exception as e:  
	print(e)
If you try to execute the above code, you will get the below output
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'abc.txt'

Approach 2:
Use of os.path() sub-module.
We will start with os.path.exists(). 
>>> import os
>>> os.path.exists("/etc/hosts")
True
>>> os.path.exists("/etc/abc.txt")
False
NOTE: os.path.exists() works for both files as well as for directory().
In some cases, after checking the file or directory exist, we need to make a distinction between file or directory. To do that, we need to use os.path.isfile() for file and os.path.isdir() for directory. It will return True if the file or directory exists; else, it will return False.
>>> os.path.isfile("/etc/hosts")    -> True
>>> os.path.isfile("/etc")   -> False
>>> os.path.isdir("/etc")   -> True
Now, if you need to write your code, you need to use a combination of both. Using os.path.exists() first, check if the file exists and then check if it’s a file if you are checking for file or dir if you are checking for a directory using and.
import os
filename="/etc/hosts"

if os.path.exists(filename) and os.path.isfile(filename):
    print("File exist")
else:
    print("File doesn't exist")
If you save the above script in test_file.py and run it, it will return File exists as an output as /etc/hosts file exist.
python3 test_file.py
File exist

Approach 3:
Use of pathlib module
This is the newest module and available starting from Python 3.4. It provides a clean object-oriented interface when dealing with Paths.
import pathlib
>>> path = pathlib.Path("/etc/hosts")
>>> path.exists()             -> True
>>> path.is_file()		-> True
>>> path.is_dir()			-> False
