A Python script to search files greater than X days old

This kind of script is helpful when your server is low in disk space and needs to search for older files and then delete them.

import os
for dirpath, dirname, filename in os.walk("/etc"):
    for file in filename:
        comp_path= os.path.join(dirpath,file)

Once we get the complete path, the next step is to find when the particular file is created to do that with the time help of os.path.getctime(filename).
>>> os.path.getctime("/etc/hosts")
1623687666.8315635

But the output of the above command is in sec. Now it’s time to introduce a new Python module called datetime. 
datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(os.path.getctime("/etc/hosts"))
datetime.datetime(2021, 6, 14, 9, 21, 6, 831563)

Now we have the date on which the file is created; the next step is to find the current date.
>>> datetime.datetime.now()
datetime.datetime(2021, 7, 4, 10, 31, 41, 664467)

The next step is to calculate the difference between the current date and the file creation date and use days() to get only the days.
time_diff=(today_date-file_creation_time).days

So your complete code will look like this
import os
import datetime

file_age=15
today_date=datetime.datetime.now()

for dir,dirpath,filename in os.walk("/var/log"):
    for file in filename:
        complete_path=os.path.join(dir,file)
        file_creation_time=datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(os.path.getctime(complete_path))
        time_diff=(today_date-file_creation_time).days
        if time_diff> file_age:
            print(complete_path, time_diff)

A Python script to search files with specific extensions and get the file size

These kinds of scripts are useful when you want to perform the cleanup operation or searching for a specific type of file.
 In this code, we need to make a slight modification
import os
for dirpath, dirname, filename in os.walk("/etc/openldap"):
    for file in filename:
        comp_path= os.path.join(dirpath,file)
        if file == "hosts":
            print(comp_path)

To match the file with the specific extension, we will use the string method endswith(). Now the if condition will look like this
if file.endswith(".conf"):
To get the file size, we are going to use the os.path.getsize() method. This method checks the size of the specified path. It returns the size of the specified path in bytes.
file_size = os.path.getsize(comp_path)
print("File size is: ", file_size, "bytes")
So our final code will look like this
import os
for dirpath, dirname, filename in os.walk("/etc/openldap"):
    for file in filename:
        comp_path= os.path.join(dirpath,file)
        if file.endswith(".conf"):
            print(comp_path)
            file_size = os.path.getsize(comp_path)
            print("File size is: ", file_size, "bytes")
