To install Java and set up the PATH environment variable on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

Update Package List:
Open a terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T and then update the package list to ensure you have the latest information about available packages:


sudo apt update
Install Java:
Ubuntu typically uses OpenJDK, which is an open-source implementation of the Java Platform. You can install it using the following command:

For OpenJDK 11 (LTS version):


sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
For OpenJDK 16 (or any other version):


sudo apt install openjdk-16-jdk
During the installation process, you might be prompted to accept the license agreement. Use the arrow keys to navigate, and then press Tab to select OK and hit Enter.

Check Java Version:
After the installation is complete, you can verify the Java version by running:


java -version
This should display information about the installed Java version.

Set Java Environment Variables:
To set the JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables, you'll need to edit the ~/.bashrc file (assuming you're using the Bash shell). You can do this using a text editor like nano:


nano ~/.bashrc
Add the following lines at the end of the file to set the JAVA_HOME and update the PATH:

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java  # Update this path if necessary
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
Press Ctrl + O to save the file, then Enter, and finally Ctrl + X to exit the nano editor.

Apply Changes:
To apply the changes you made to the ~/.bashrc file, either close the terminal and reopen it, or run:

source ~/.bashrc
Verify PATH Setup:
You can verify that the PATH is set correctly by running:


echo $PATH
Make sure that the path to the Java bin directory is included in the output.

That's it! You've successfully installed Java and set up the PATH environment variable on your Ubuntu system.
