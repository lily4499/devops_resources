Let's clarify the role of these two files:

known_hosts: This file on your local machine contains the fingerprints of remote servers' public keys that you have previously connected to. When you connect to a server, SSH compares its public key's fingerprint with the one stored in your known_hosts file to verify the server's identity.

authorized_keys: This file is located on the remote server. It contains the public keys of authorized users. When you try to connect to a server using SSH key authentication, your local private key is matched against the public keys stored in the authorized_keys file of the remote server.

Since you mentioned that you don't have an authorized_keys file on the remote server, it means that key-based authentication is not set up for the user you're trying to log in as.

Here's what you can do:

Set Up Key-Based Authentication: If you want to use SSH key-based authentication, you need to create an authorized_keys file on the remote server. You should place the public key of the user you're logging in as into this file.

Here's how you can create the authorized_keys file and add your public key (assuming you have your public key available):

bash
Copy code
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
echo "your-public-key-here" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Replace "your-public-key-here" with the actual content of your public key.

Password Authentication: If you don't want to set up key-based authentication, you can connect using password authentication (if allowed by the server's configuration). Just use the -o PasswordAuthentication=yes option with the ssh command:

bash
Copy code
ssh -o PasswordAuthentication=yes lili@hostname
