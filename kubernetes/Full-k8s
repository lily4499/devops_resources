k8s is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications. 

what problem k8s solve:
features of k8s: monitoring, self healing, high availability, loadbalancing, autoscaling
alternatives of kubernetes:

In real time especially when you move from monolith to microservices there will be hundreds even thousands of containers running on multiple nodes
we never know when and which container goes down 
so what if there is a way to monitor the health of each container and node , then automatically bring them back when they go down: it is called self healing or resilience

kubernetes checks or monitors the health of each container and node and brings them back when they go down so we will not face any downtime ; we call this availability

what if there is a way to increase the number of containers if the load increases , and decrease the number of containers if the load decreases this is called scaling 

not only scaling containers but it can scale nodes also meaning if there are multiple containers are running in a node and while creating a new container if there are not enough
resources like cpu and ram kubernetes can automatically spin up another container for us and kubernetes can run our containers in a node based on the resources available

this is called automatic bin packing
