k8s is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications. 
docker creates container, then k8s manage those containers
k8s cluster = master node or control plane(API server, Etcd, scheduler(schedule pod on the)) + worker node

what problem k8s solve:
features of k8s: monitoring, self healing, high availability, loadbalancing, autoscaling, rolling and canary deployment, 
alternatives of kubernetes:docker swarm, MESOS, AWS ECS, k8s(st popular with most advanced features)

In real time especially when you move from monolith to microservices there will be hundreds even thousands of containers running on multiple nodes
we never know when and which container goes down 
so what if there is a way to monitor the health of each container and node , then automatically bring them back when they go down: it is called self healing or resilience

kubernetes checks or monitors the health of each container and node and brings them back when they go down so we will not face any downtime ; we call this availability

what if there is a way to increase the number of containers if the load increases , and decrease the number of containers if the load decreases this is called scaling 

not only scaling containers but it can scale nodes also meaning if there are multiple containers are running in a node and while creating a new container if there are not enough
resources like cpu and ram kubernetes can automatically spin up another container for us and kubernetes can run our containers in a node based on the resources available
4:02
this is called automatic bin packing

and if there is no load it can remove the node which can save lot of cost also if a node crashes it can move the container to the ld and running node 
we can also tell kubernetes that how much resources a container should use

with rolling deployments we can replace the containers one by one that way your application will still serve the request without any downtime
with kubernetes we can also upgrade a percentage of containers which is called canary deployments

With kubernetes we can deploy and update secrets and application configuration without rebuilding our image and without exposing secrets in your stack configuration
