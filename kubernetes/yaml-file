To deploy a Spring Boot application on Minikube, you'll need several YAML files to define the Kubernetes resources required for your application. Below, I'll provide an example of these YAML files:

Deployment YAML (deployment.yaml):


apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: spring-boot-app
spec:
  replicas: 2  # Adjust the number of replicas as needed
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: spring-boot-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: spring-boot-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: spring-boot-app
          image: your-spring-app-image:tag  # Replace with your Spring Boot application image
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080  # Adjust the port if your Spring Boot app listens on a different port


            
Service YAML (service.yaml):


apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: spring-boot-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: spring-boot-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80  # Port on which you want to expose the service
      targetPort: 8080  # Port your Spring Boot app is listening on
  type: NodePort  # Change to "LoadBalancer" or "ClusterIP" as needed

  
Ingress YAML (optional, ingress.yaml):


apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: spring-boot-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: your-hostname.com  # Replace with your desired hostname
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: spring-boot-service
                port:
                  number: 80


                  
ConfigMap YAML (configmap.yaml) for Spring Boot application configuration (if needed):


apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: spring-boot-config
data:
  application.properties: |
    # Your Spring Boot application configuration here
Secret YAML (secret.yaml) for sensitive data (if needed):


apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: spring-boot-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: base64-encoded-username
  password: base64-encoded-password
Make sure to replace placeholders like your-spring-app-image:tag, your-hostname.com, and any specific configuration data with the appropriate values for your Spring Boot application.

You can apply these YAML files using the kubectl apply command. For example:

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
# Apply other YAML files as needed
This example includes basic resource definitions for deploying a Spring Boot application on Minikube. Depending on your application's requirements, you may need to customize these YAML files further, especially for things like environment variables, storage, and resource limits.
